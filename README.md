# MTA_turnstile_data

This project is created for the purpose of The Data Incubator (TDI) code challenge. The challenge asks to 
"Propose a project to do while at The Data Incubator... Propose a project that uses a large, publicly accessible dataset. Explain your motivation for tackling this problem, discuss the data source(s) you are using, and explain the analysis you are performing. At a minimum, you will need to do enough exploratory data analysis to convince someone that the project is viable and generate two interesting non-trivial plots or other assets supporting this. Explain the plots and give url links to them."

General description:

The Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) runs huge public transportation networks. According to MTA's website, the networks connect 12 counties in southeastern New York, along with two counties in southwestern Connecticut, carrying over 11 million passengers on an average weekday system-wide, and over 800,000 vehicles on its seven toll bridges and two tunnels per weekday. There are millions of millions of data generated over the years reflecting the commuters' behaviors. 

This project focuses on analysizing the turnstile usage data generated from MTA New York City Transit (aka New York City Subway). The turnstile usage data are essentially the geographic and time distribution of the commuter behavior (enter or exit). These data can be used to turn into a wide range of knowledge. For example, NYPD can use it to decide where and when to send police for security purposes and how many possibally needed. Food trucks can use it to decide when and where to sell food/drink, especially at the non-peak times. Delivery services can use it to do delivery business or set up some (pop-up) self-pickup lockers near those temporary popular sites. Telecommunication service can use it to deliver extra pop-up signal boosters. In general, this data can be used to run pop-up business or public service. 

Anthor major thing is to give a sence of how the pendamic changes the city. By comparing the commuter data, we can know things like where the essential workers live and work, how confident New Yorkers feel to return to social life since the restrictions gradually lifted, etc. 

Along with many charts possibly created by the concepts explained above, it is also cool if we can visualize the commutor numbers on the map over time.

Another possible and interesting idea is to analysize the turnstil data along with the MTA's real-time data feeds. We can know things like when and which line more subway service is needed.
